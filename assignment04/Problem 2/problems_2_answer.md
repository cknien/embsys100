**Create a function with multiple arguments (5 arguments for example) and call that function from within another function. Trace thru the assembler and note:**

*a. How does the calling function pass the values to the called function?*

*b. What extra code did the compiler generate before calling the function with the multiple arguments?*

*c. What extra code did the compiler generate inside the called function with the multiple list of arguments?*

*d. Any other observations?*
