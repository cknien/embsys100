**Question:**
Why use two’s complement to represent negative numbers?

**Answer:**
Because two’s complement gives computer the capability of dealing with addition and subtraction of negative numbers 
without any other operations. 

And you won’t have 2 zeros. Ex. If no two’s complement, in 4 bits system, 0000 = zero, 1000 = negative zero?
